    description: |
      I should like to ask about a list of symptoms that some people get when they are anxious or have attacks of panic. Do you have any of these?

      The list may be presented by the interviewer one item at a time, or as prompt card, to R directly. In either case, the terminology used should be appropriate for local circumstances and culture. For example, 'butterflies' will only be understood in a few parts of the world. Other examples should be found for the same symptom. Some respondents may attest to these symptoms in addition to other somatic complaints but attribute them to a disabling physical cause for which they have sought medical help, or if that is not available have engaged in self treatment with physical remedies. Use somatoform checklists in Section 2 and rate 2.127 if panic attacks ( 4.020 ) are also rated present in this Section. When rating these items, ask first the presence of each item, making a tick mark. Then determine the temporal relationships between items and rate 1, 2 or 3 as appropriate. Do not rate anxiety if due to appropriate environmental circumstances.

       ### Phobias are listed in items <4.027> - <4.045>.

       The list may be presented by the interviewer one item at a time, or as a prompt card, to the respondent directly. In either case, the terminology used should be appropriate for local circumstances and culture. For example, train phobias will rarely (but possibly) be found in areas with no railways. Use examples appropriate to the meaning of each item and to the circumstances and culture in which the interview takes place.

       Rate only items that have caused distress and intense fear and/or anxiety symptoms at some time since onset of the disorder. Avoidance is very common but not essential for identification. Phobias should only be rated 2 if associated with autonomic symptoms at some time since the disorder began, either in feared real or imagined situations (e.g., trains in a place with no railways).

       R **must** acknowledge that their fear is excessive or unreasonable. If associated with obsessional symptoms, rate phobias here and the nature of the association at <5.008>.

       If associated with affective symptoms, rate at <6.022>.

Do you have to spend a lot of time washing things repeatedly that are already clean? - There are other difficulties of a similar kind, like unpleasant and unwanted thoughts or images coming into the mind, which can't be resisted. Has that been a problem? If any evidence that there might be section 5 symptoms, probe further: - Can you describe what it is like? - Where do these ideas or impulses come from? - Do you try to resist them - for example, to stop yourself from ... ? (What happens?) - Do you get very upset or distressed when you can't control it? - How severe has it been? - How often has it occurred during PERIOD? Most days? For as long as a fortnight? Longer? CUT OFF => to 6.001 if no evidence for Section 5 symptoms. When did the symptoms start? How old were you? Is this the first time you have had them? Enter age at 5.013 . The ideas and impulses are experienced as entering the mind against conscious resistance. R tries to resist them but fails. They are unpleasantly repetitive. They are acknowledged as excessive or unreasonable and recognized as part of R's own thoughts and much distress is caused by this, since the thoughts may be embarrassing or blasphemous. Thoughts (obsessions) and actions (compulsions) are closely connected and can be rated together under each item. In very chronic conditions, the resistance may lose force: therefore take history into account. Use the probes to explore and rate the following symptoms: Rate items 5.002 - 5.006 on Scale I, omitting the rating of 1. 1 This rating is not appropriate in the case of obsessions and should not be used. 2 Most days for at least 2 weeks, moderate severity. 3 As 2 but severe. 5 Difficult to differentiate from psychotic symptoms."

You mentioned ... [summarize symptoms for R] - Some people say they are depressed because they have phobias or anxiety: they are miserable because of that. If the phobias or anxiety cleared up they would not be depressed any more. - Other people say that if only the depression would go, they would stop being anxious. - Can you decide if one or the other is more important for you or is there little to choose between them? Probe further. Use examples below if appropriate. Anxiety and depression must both be rated present for this item to be meaningful. 0 - Absent, or symptoms of one type only. 1- Anxiety is primary. Depression appears to be entirely explicable in terms of the limitations placed on the subject by the symptoms of anxiety, e.g. being unable to leave the house, travel, meet people, etc., or being afraid of heart disease because of palpitations. 2 - Anxiety and depression both present but seem independent of each other, or fluctuating in predominance: e.g. onset of depression makes any preceding anxiety more severe, or vice versa. 3 - Depression is primary. Anxiety is either a result of the depression (e.g. subject is frightened because of morbid or suicidal ideas) or it takes the form of fears of catastrophe, forebodings about illness or death, dread of having to face the day when first waking in the morning, preoccupation that something awful is going to happen. Panic attacks and situational anxiety, if present, are secondary to depression. 8 - Uncertain, e.g. because of lack of information. In Section 13 reconsider clinical judgement of relationship of depressive syndrome to other syndromes.

The presence and severity of psychiatric symptoms is rated in detail throughout SCAN, and the relevant sections should be considered before rating this item. A clinical judgement should be based on all the information available, not just the answers to the probes. In the case of psychotic symptoms e.g. alcoholic hallucinosis, an attribution of cause should only be made if there is no or only minor clouding: onset is typically within 48 hours but may be up to two weeks after drinking. To be rated here, psychotic symptoms should persist for at least 48 hours but no more than 6 months. Rate the form of cognitive impairment of various kinds due to alcohol at items 21.127, 21.134, 21.137, 21.138. Mental health problems due to alcohol may also be rated in Section 13 and 20. 0 No symptoms definitely attributable to alcohol use. 1 Impaired judgement and dysfunctional behavior. 2 Anxiety (S.4) and obsessive compulsive symptoms (S.5). 3 Depressive symptoms including psychotic depression (S.6). 4 Sleep and sexual dysfunction symptoms (S.8). 5 Manic symptoms including bipolar affective disorder (S.10). 6 Perceptual distortions, etc. (S.16). 7 Hallucinations, particularly auditory (S.17). 8 Section 18 experiences or bizarre delusions. 9 Non-affective delusions, including morbid jealousy (S.19). 10 Polymorphic symptoms. 11 Mixed symptoms. 12 Cognitive impairment (S.21)."

When did you start using [DRUG/S]? How old were you? What effects do/did [DRUG/S] have? Would it be difficult to do without [DRUG/S]? Has there been any change in pattern of use since then? Have you ever felt you had problems with [DRUG/S]? - Could you describe the problems? - Were the problems worse in the past year or earlier? Use this information in subsequent examination. Avoid repetition if later probes have already been answered. The following items should be rated for the past year and/or a previous period of drug use. Frequency of use of each drug during period:"

      The presence and severity of psychiatric symptoms is rated in detail throughout SCAN, and the relevant sections should be considered before rating this item. The purpose is to specify whether drug taking is the cause of the most severe type of symptom present. A clinical judgement should be based on all the information available, not just the answers to the probes. Psychotic symptoms must have occurred within 2 weeks of drug taking, and persist for at least 48 hours and less than 6 months. Do not include symptoms that occur on withdrawal only. Rate the form of cognitive impairment due to drugs, which is rated at items 21.128, 21.135, 21.139, and 21.140 . More detailed attributions can also be made using the optional attributional scale and the dashed boxes at an item level, and at the section level in Sections 13 and 20.

Both ICD-10 and DSM-III, III-R and IV, require the exclusion of attributions of ''cause'', particularly in relation to the judged effects of psychoactive substances and alcohol, other treatments, physical (or ''organic'') disease. Users of SCAN who wish to make use of these classification systems must therefore attempt to consider the grounds for making judgements of this kind. Although opportunity to do so at the item level using the optional attributional scale is present for many items, Section 13 allows the user to re-rate these at a syndromal level, for the purposes of classification, in order to permit the future scientific investigation of the reliability and validity of such attributions. Note: Users should establish that ratings of attribution can be made reliably. As far as is practicable, such attributional ratings should be delayed until the ''causal'' status of any attribution can be established with reasonable certainty. Rate quality of data available at 13.033 below. SKIP => to 13.050 if data inadequate (13.033 = 0)."

B There is a presumed relationship between the development (or marked exacerbation) of the underlying disease, damage, or dysfunction, and the mental disorder, the symptoms of which may have immediate onset or may be delayed. C There is insufficient evidence for an alternative causation of the mental disorder, e.g. strong family history of a clinically similar or related disorder. Rate 1 if attribution is suspected but criteria A, B, and C are not satisfied. If not rate 0. If criteria A, B, and C are met, rate 2.

      R feels that the familiar environment has changed in a way that puzzles her or him and which she or he may not be able to describe clearly, but there is no doubt that the feeling is extremely unusual and different from any other kind of feeling.

      - Is it like being a robot or zombie or puppet, controlled from elsewhere, without a will of your own? - That your intentions have actually been replaced by those of ... ? Do not rate 'as if' answers. The experience of replacement is essential. The will is experienced as diminished or replaced by that of some other agency. The expansion of will commonly experienced in elation, so that R feels, e.g., as powerful as if God were responsible (or that R is God), is not a delusion of control and should be excluded. Any answers obviously led by the questions must be verified against a free description by R. Experience of the phenomenon is essential. Rating Scale II EXPERIENCE OF REPLACEMENT OF WILL
      The essential element in the definition is that R experiences his or her will as replaced by the intentions of some other force or agency. No positive rating should be made without unequivocal evidence and a recorded example. E.g., a statement that the radio or some supernatural force is 'controlling' or 'influencing' the respondent without a description of the basic experience is insufficient. Do not make a positive rating if R is incapable of clear exposition. The examiner should be particularly careful about rating in the presence of predominant depressed or manic mood: it is the experience itself and not an explanation or elaboration of symptoms based on mood change, that is being rated.
      If there is any possibility that involuntary possession experience ( 2.106 - 2.108 ) is present, consider also 19.024 .
      SKIP => to 18.018 if no evidence for experience of replaced will.

Examiners should be particularly cautious before making ratings in Part Two of SCAN on respondents who appear to exhibit features similar to those specified in Annex 2. The examiner should consider carefully ratings in Part One, Section 2 (dissociative and somatoform disorders), Sections 3 and 4 (anxiety disorders) and Section 6. The clinical history schedule (Section 27) should also be completed ( i.e. 27.053 - 27.069 ). Examiners who are not members of R's culture should carefully reconsider whether it is possible to complete, unaided, a reliable SCAN assessment (item 20.114 ).
      Include Koro, Latah, Witigo, or other such specified condition. The item should be rated 1 only if a full PSE10 interview has been completed, and ICD-10 DCR Annex 2 used to match clinical presentation with description in DCR.

Users of SCAN who wish to make use of such classification systems must therefore attempt to consider the grounds for making judgements of this kind, here in relation to Part Two symptoms. Although opportunity to do so at the item level using the optional attribution rating scale is present in earlier sections, Section 20 allows the user to re-rate these at a syndromal level, in order to permit the scientific investigation of the reliability and validity of such attributions. Note: Users should establish that ratings of attribution can be made reliably . As far as is practicable, such attributional ratings should be delayed until the ''causal'' status of any attribution can be established with reasonable certainty.

B There is a presumed relationship between the development (or marked exacerbation) of the underlying disease, damage, or dysfunction, and the mental disorder, the symptoms of which may have immediate onset or may be delayed. C There is insufficient evidence for an alternative causation of the mental disorder, e.g. strong family history of a clinically similar or related disorder. Rate 1 if attribution is suspected but criteria A, B, and C are not satisfied. If not rate 0. If criteria A, B, and C are met, rate 2. If in addition the following criterion D can be met, the attribution can be regarded as more certain and rate 3. Rate 8 or 9 as in Scale I. Keep careful records of the evidence upon which ratings are based: D There is recovery from or significant improvement in the mental disorder following removal or improvement of the underlying presumed cause."

The attribution of abnormal traumas and stressors is required for ICD-10 and DSM (all revisions since III) and is dealt with in Section 13 (stress and adjustment disorders). Stress induced psychoses as defined in ICD-10 can also be rated in this Section, as can the attribution of psychosocial cause, treatment etc. Items should have been rated already in the appropriate sections of Part Two (items 20.0, 20.0 - 20.0 ). These attributions are only required for symptoms that are definitely present during the period. Did adverse events or circumstance have any influence or cause the problems you have described (prompt Part One symptoms) during the PERIOD? - How important were they? - For example: [use prompt card if it would be helpful.] - Were they the main cause or did they just make things worse or keep them going?"

    description: |
      This item is to be rated on the basis of what is observed in the interview and by others who have long-term contact with the subject. Restricted affect refers to observed behaviors rather than the subject's subjective experience. Specifically, one rates:
      a. A relatively expressionless face, or unchanging facial expression.
      b. Reduced expressive gestures when emotional material is discussed. c. Diminished vocal inflection.
      It is important to distinguish primary restricted affect from a guarded speaking style which is caused by suspiciousness, or a relatively normally reticence or shyness in an interview. These secondary features should be distinguished from a truly restricted affect, and should lead to a rating of 0 or 1 on this item. Information from other sources may be helpful in making such distinctions.

If R shows any evidence of cognitive impairment or decline, regardless of subthreshold MMSE or Verbal Trails scores, proceed to 21.025 . SKIP => to 22.001 if no evidence of cognitive impairment."

    title: "The Structure of Item Groups and Rating Procedure"
    description: |
      Ratings of item groups should be entered in fixed format on the coding sheets, in the Record Book, or directly into the boxes provided in the SCAN schedule (including the computer version).
      The items constituting each Item Group are listed in the Checklist with their names. They provide a general guide to the content of each IG. The PSE item definitions, and criteria for presence and severity, should be used as models when rating the presence of IGs. The threshold for rating a symptom present should be at least as high as that set in the PSE for the relevant item. These levels are specified against each item and raters are expected to be familiar with their clinical meaning as defined in PSE10. If in doubt, rate 8.
      It would occasionally be possible, if informants or case records were able to provide sufficient information, to score the IGs by rating each constituent symptom. This practice is not recommended, since in such a case the ratings would more easily be entered using the PSE. Each Item Group is given an overall rating based on the number of constituent symptoms present during the period and the severity of the distress or disablement that accompanies them. Clinical judgement is required in all cases, because the information will often be scanty. In addition, the criteria for rating specified Rating Scale IV must sometimes be relaxed on clinical grounds. For example, IG7 ( 26.024 ) is composed of five types of obsessional symptoms, but any one of them can be totally disabling (therefore rate 2). And if one type is present, and associated with only moderate disablement, it is still proper to give a rating of 1. The instructions for rating must be interpreted with clinical common sense.
      A count of the number of IGs rated 8 (unsure whether present or absent) forms part of the output. Free use should be made of this rating, for example if the presence of psychotic or 'physical' symptoms make the rating of non-psychotic IGs difficult. Traits are not considered when rating IGs. Since the information will sometimes be scanty, it is important to follow the general SCAN rule: 'When in doubt, choose the less definite or less severe rating': 0 rather than 8, 8 rather than 1, 1 rather than 2.

      Checks on PSE10 and IGC ratings

      Take the opportunity, while reviewing all available information on the clinical history, to check the ratings of history items in PSE10 and IGC. Consider the following in particular:

      <Section 0> (SCAN Face Sheet) information.

      <Section 1> (Episodes [also re-rated within Sections if dates vary], Medication, Psychosocial Intervention, Clinical History) dates and other clinical data.

      Dates of first onset and episode dates in PSE10 Sections.

      Attributions of organic, psychosocial, and other causes in relation to PSE10 Sections in Section 13 and 20.

      Items that relate one section to another. For example, <6.022> (anxiety and depression), which can also be reviewed in Section 13.

      Items for rating aspects of the clinical course. For example, <6.030> - <6.036> (episodes of depression).

      ## Rating the Clinical History Schedule (CHS)

      The PSE and IGC systematize and operationalise the collection of information relevant to disorders in sections F0 to F5 of ICD-10 and their equivalents in DSM-III-R and DSM-IV. They also provide opportunities for rating specific aspects of the clinical course.

      The CHS is intended to supplement this information by providing an opportunity to check or enter data relevant to the broader clinical and social history and also to rate the presence or absence of disorders in ICD-10 F6 F9.

      Several of the items involve rating R's performance relative to an average defined by local expectation. This involves an informed judgement, which can only be made by someone familiar with the culture and environment in which the respondent lives. See Glossary comment.

      If the CHS is used, item <0.015> on the Face Sheet should show the entry '1'.

      Cut-off points are included in Sections 1, 3 and 5 of the CHS. All other CHS Sections should be completed in full.

      Ratings are specified in the text. With the exception of continuous variables,

    title: ". OVERALL CLINICAL DIAGNOSES"
    description: |
      The SCAN system provides, as one of its outputs, a classification according to the rules laid down in various nosologies. This is a 'reference classification rather than a clinical diagnosis. It is recommended that an independent clinical diagnosis be made as well in all cases. Comparison between the two classifications will often be of interest, both from a scientific and a case-management point of view. Provision is made below for three types of diagnostic system to be used.
      For ICD-10, enter chapter letter, followed by up to 4 digits, starting in the left box, e.g. F22 = [F22 ], F22.00 = [F22 00]. For DSM-IV, enter up to 5 digits, e.g. 295.30 = [295 30] Diagnosis at key date 27 _ 071 ICD-10 first diagnosis
