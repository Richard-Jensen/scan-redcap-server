  options:
    0: This is a positive rating of absence. It does not mean 'not known' or 'uncertain whether present or not'. It can only be used if sufficient information is available to establish its accuracy.
    1: This is a positive rating of presence, but presence of such a minor degree that it is not appropriate for use in classification. Like (0) it does not mean 'not known' or 'uncertain'. Ratings of (1) count in scores (but not for diagnostic purposes), which in turn influence the level allocated on the Index of Definition.
    2: This rating means that the item is present at a level sufficient to use in classification. For this purpose it is equivalent to 3, but it contributes less to scores. In general, it is used when symptoms are of moderate severity during most of the period being assessed.
    3: A rating of (3) is similar to (2) except that the symptom is present in severe form for most of the period under review.
    5: The presence of psychotic symptoms can make the rating of Part One items very difficult, bevause of problems in interpreting the meaning of what R says, or because the symptoms (for example, anxiety or a phobia about leaving one's house) may themselves be based in psychotic experiences. The rating should only be made when there is genuine doubt about the nature of the symptom or the balance is in favor of the symptom being psychotic.
    8: If, after an adequate examination, the interviewer is still not sure whether a symptom is present (rated 1-3) or absent (rated 0), the rating is (8). This is the only circumstance in which (8) is used. It should not be used to indicate a mild form of the symptom.
    9: This rating is only used if the information needed to rate an item is incomplete in some respect, for example because of language or cognitive disorder, or lack of cooperation, or because the interviewer forgot to probe sufficiently deeply. It is distinguished from (8) because the examination was not, for whatever reason, carried out adequately. In the SCAN text, an instruction to 'use Scale I' simply means that it is not necessary to point out any individual rating characteristics for that item. Any point on Scale I can be selected, according to clinical judgement.
