      Clinically, the difference between normality and the pathological behaviour may be based on a clinical judgment on how impaired and distressed the patient is by the health anxiety.

      We may need an introduction including the discussion about MUS, mental vs. bodily, and that these conditions not nessesarily present mental disorders but are in between.

      This item is concerned with the Respondent's own view of his or her physical health status; i.e. not only with the presence or absence of disease or disability but also with general physical well-being.  Respondents will use their own terms to describe health status.  The rating should          reflect this personal assessment rather than interviewer's interpretation of it.

      A rating of 1 must be based on a positive statement of physical well-being. Reasonably well (rated 2) corresponds to 'all right'; not positive, not negative.

      A rating of 3 ('fair') implies less than average wellness. Such a statement should be elucidated to inform subsequent questioning.  It may, for example, indicate physical disease, functional or dissociative or affective disorder, or a lifelong tendency (trait) to take a somewhat gloomy view of      things. These questions are raised later in the interview.

      Any statement implying a seriously poor state of health is rated 4.

      A feeling of positive wellness can be rated 1 in the presence of actual disease or disability if that is what R feels.

      The scale is ordered in this way (1-4) to correspond with the general principle used elsewhere in the SCAN text, that greater disability or pathology has a higher score.

      Thus 0 is not used, because, as the default rating for all items (except some in Section 21), it would automatically             indicate high positive wellness if left blank.

      This item refers to medical problems of a physical nature including illnesses, injuries and disabilities.

      Take into account all the information available including the results of recent investigations and examinations. It will sometimes be possible to accept the diagnosis that R gives, when backed by a convincing description, but always use 8 if there is doubt.

      Any medically diagnosed condition should be coded in **2.007** according to ICD-10.  If no significant illness or disability is present leave **2.007 and 2.008** blank.

      An entry should only be made if **2.003** is coded 2 or 3; not including any indefinite or medically unexplained disorder.

      For instance stomach ache without good evidence of gastric disease, should not be entered simply because R states, for example, "I think I have a gastric ulcer". A rating of 1 does not mean that there is no physical disease, only that the information has not established one and further enquiry      is necessary.

      Rate on the basis of present information, incl. medical history. Each symptom is rated if present, and do not attempt to judge if each individual symptom is "medically explained" or not. The diagnoses is based on the complete illness picture and not on individual symptoms!
      Emotional, social, stress ect. may not be present in patients presenting with functional disorders why you can not base you rating on such associated symptoms.
      Ideally one should rate if a symptom is due to a functional condition (like you rate if a symptoms is due a depression) but our current knowledge's and most doctors knowledge's about functional disorders is not sufficient for the time being that this can be done in a reliable way.
      For a symptom to be rated as being attributed to well-known physical disease (or likely well-known physical disease), this well-known physical disease must be diagnosable, i.e. be diagnosed in 2.007 or it could be an acute condition such as a flu. If you suspect that the patient has an                undiagnosed physical disease, rate 8.  Functional somatic syndromes or functional disorders is not viewed as well-defined medical conditions.

      The usual PSE rule 'if in doubt rate down' should not be applied to physical symptoms themselves.  Respondents should be encouraged to be forthcoming about their complaints.

      Because each symptom can be described in terms that are highly culture-specific, the list is not exhaustive. There are sufficient items to cover contingencies. A clinical decision has to be made on the basis of local expert according to which item represents the complaint the most.         For research purposes, it is important to record the terms used by respondents to describe their problems. Documentation of these terms will generate a data base that can be used for further development of items with research and clinical applicability.

      Research have shown that symptoms of some functional disorders cluster into organ systems. Therefor a alternative/complementary rating is also possible in which you simply ask if symptoms of that organ system is presented or not. If negative you may skip the organ system. If the interviewer is      experienced or  it is not  need to specific  individual symptoms one may only use the alternative/complementary rating.

      Unwarranted fatiguability after even minor physical exertion or mental exercise.  The emphasis is on feelings of bodily or physical weakness and exhaustion after only minimal effort, accompanied by a feeling of muscular aches and pains.  Respondents experience the tiredness as unpleasant and        distressing.

      **Differentiation from other symptoms:**

      Tiredness at the end of a hard day of physical or mental work (rate 0), or due to the after-effect of influenza, would not count.  The level of increase in fatiguability should be assessed against relevant previous experience, such as walking a familiar distance, climbing stairs,  reading a         book, doing calculations,etc.
      Is typically described as an unpleasant intrusion of distracting associations or recollections, difficulty in concentrating, focusing and sustaining attention, and generally inefficient thinking.  The condition is usually associated with decreased efficiency in coping with daily tasks.
      Inability to restore mental and physical energy after excessive fatigue following even minor exercise.  This is a prolongation, lasting days or longer.  The sense of tiredness is usually accompanied by feelings of muscular aches and pains, and the Respondent is unable voluntarily to overcome        it. A main feature is inability to relax fully.

    scale: 1a
    glossary: |
      R complains of impairment or loss of memory.  The loss does not include anaesthesia for operations or during convulsions or fainting, or following head injury.
      See also ???

      Dissociative: The main feature is sudden loss of memory, usually of important recent events, not due to organic mental disorder and too great to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness or fatigue.  There is no integration of present experiences with memories of the past.  The amnesia is       presumed to be of psychogenic origin and is usually partial and selective.  The main problem is not in the registration or retention of the memory, but in the recall of facts usually associated with insoluble or unacceptable interpersonal problems, or traumatic events such as accidents or           unexpected bereavements.  The loss of memory may be an expression of emotional needs or failure of effective coping mechanisms.

      **Dissociative: Differentiation from other symptoms:**

      There should be no evidence of a physical disorder that can explain the symptoms that characterize the disorder.  Amnesia induced by alcohol or drugs or by postictal amnesia in epilepsy should not be included here. Similarly,  subjective complaints of loss of memory (difficulty in                 recollection of important facts and events) experienced in depressive disorders should be distinguished.  Likewise, it is differentiated from other causes of subjective memory problem by the severity,  sudden onset or only affecting a specific event, and thus it may not necessarily be global          memory loss.

      There is a declared sensory loss on the skin which often has boundaries that do not fit into any neurological deficit.  These may be associated with different sensations like tingling or other paraesthesias.  There may be differential loss between the sensory modalities (touch, pain, heat,          vibration, etc.) which cannot be due to a neurological problem.

      Pseudoseizures. Convulsions may mimic epileptic seizures in which whole or parts of the body shake.  However, dissociative convulsions are usually longer in duration and with tongue biting and bruising due to falling, incontinence of urine is rare (but can occur).  There is not a true loss of            consciousness but a state of trance or dissociative stupor.

      A positive rating should not be made without full neurological investigation resulting in no evidence of organic disorder.  Pseudoseizures may be present in individuals with true epilepsy, complicating differentiation.

    title: Dissociative or conversion disorder
    description: |
      The symptoms rated elsewhere in chapter 2 can also be dissociative.
    scale: 1a
    glossary: |
      Dissociative symptoms are all characterized by a partial or complete disconnection between memories of the past, awareness of identity and of immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements.  Conscious control over which memories and sensations can be selected for immediate attention, and     what movements can be carried out, is impaired, although varying in degree from day to day and even from hour to hour.  The severity of impairment is often difficult to determine clinically.

      The terms 'hysteria' and 'conversion' are avoided in ICD-10, and dissociative symptoms are presumed to be 'psychogenic' in origin, because closely associated with traumatic events, intolerable or insoluble problems, or disturbed relationships.  No particular theory of the mechanisms underlying      dissociation is assumed for purposes of this Glossary but secondary gain is a suggestive feature.

      People with dissociative symptoms often deny problems that are obvious to others.  An informant is then essential for proper rating.

      See also items **17.020**, dissociative hallucinations, and **20.026** - **20.029**, which constitute the Checklist for Induced Psychosis.

      For a definite rating the following features must be present:

      1. The clinical characteristics specified at each item.
      2. Some evidence of psychological causation - e.g. convincing temporal association with stressful events, relationship or other problems or needs - often denied by the respondent.  This requires a clinical judgement, usually based also on information from another informant. Association with            stress is rated at **2.065**.
      3. The presence of any relevant disorder of the central or peripheral nervous system should be specified at items **2.007a-t**.  If this fully explains the symptom, rate 9. Organic attribution should otherwise be rated as usual
      4. Positive ratings should never be made if the appropriate physical investigations have not been carried out.  Rate 8 in this case.

      **Differentiation from other symptoms:**

      Depersonalization and derealization are not associated with loss of conscious control over access to sensations, memories or movements, and only limited aspects of personal identity are affected.  In depersonalization, there may be a loss of the sense of self, but the people affected know who       they are.

Onset is convincingly associated in time with a traumatic life event with intolerable or insoluble problems, or with disturbed interpersonal relationships, which R may not acknowledge or be aware of.  Loss of consciousness       or any other bodily function may be a sign of emotional need or conflict.  A disinterested informant is usually necessary.

      Illness worries and preoccupation is also often presented in functional disorders and in other conditions and thus not restricted to Health anxiety.  Therfore, this section should be used in any case of functional complaints and not only if Health anxiety / Hypochondria is suspected.

      Delineation from normality (may need editing)
      Being attentive about one's health and bodily functions is important for the survival of human beings as it is a precondition for taking care of ourselves and seeking help if necessary. Illness worrying or health anxiety is thus on a dimension from being too little aware of their body signals       and functioning to patients severely disabled by unfounded health worries. The demarcation between and mal reactions and pathological health anxiety can not be established rigorously as it is the case in many other disorders.

      Differences between OCD, Anxiety and Health anxiety.
      Despite there may seem to be some clinical similarities between OCD and health anxiety, there is little evidence for this. Although patients with OCD may have different compulsions or obsessions, it is the same compulsions, images and thoughts that keep returning again and again in a very     stereotypical form. Contrary to this, the worries and thoughts in health anxiety are not so stereotypical but vary much more with multiple thoughts and considerations about illnesses. A patient with health anxiety feels compelled to see a doctor to get reassured, but this is not because of a        compulsion saying that they need to see a doctor, but because they fear a health problem. Patients with health anxiety do not usually have other compulsions or obsessions. In health anxiety, the rumination is usually triggered by an external or internal stimulus like hearing about illness, and      the worrying usually relates to the trigger, whereas obsessive thoughts in OCD are usually solely intrusive with no specific trigger, although they may be a reaction to a stressor.

      Severe health worrying is a normal reaction when a severe disease such as cancer is suspected. The reaction has similar characteristics as other stress reactions to life events and is transient and disappears when the suspected disease is excluded or treated. The preoccupation is not excessive or     disproportionate in the light of the condition that is suspected, and usually patients do not panic but cope with their fear. In this case, is rated 0.
      However, such a real threat to health may trigger the onset of severe worries or  health anxiety. The patient is usually aware that the worries and preoccupations are unfounded or disproportionate if asked in a considerate way, despite it may be difficult for the patient to realise this during      an attack of overwhelming health anxiety.

    glossary: |
      A non-delusional preoccupation with fears of harboring a severe physical disease and/or a disproportionate toughs about the seriousness of one's symptoms and disease.
      The symptom has the characteristics of worrying (see **3.001**) but is also distinguished:

      (I)	By an intense preoccupation with apparently normal sensations or physical signs or appearances.
      If a medical condition is present the preoccupation is clearly excessive or disproportionate.

      **Differentiation from other symptoms:**

      Moderate to severe social disablement often accompanies the symptom.

      If there is true conviction of the presence of a nonexistent disease, rate at item **2.109** (repeated at **19.028** and, if in context of depressed mood, at **19.027**, and **19.028**).  Somatic hallucinations and delusional elaboration are rated at **17.028** and **17.029**.

      Phobias of contracting disease (**4.044**), or of medical situations (**4.043**), should be distinguished if they lack the two characteristics specified above.

      Obsessional preoccupation with the possibility of harm from contamination or infection (**5.005**), must have the characteristic resistance against subjective compulsion.

      The differentiation from phobias and obsessions can be difficult.  If criteria for more than one symptom are satisfied, each should be rated on its merits.  One does not exclude the others.

      The patient has thoughts or ideas about suffering from a disease that they can not, or only with great difficulty, stop. All thoughts are centred on a suspected disease, and the patient finds more and more "evidence" that he/she suffers from an often severe disease. The growing anxiety spiral       may ultimately make the patient seek medical attention. Rumination seems quite specific for health anxiety in the sense that other functional disorders that may present with illness worries do not display this symptom. But ruminations may also be present in (other) mental disorders like            anxiety disorders and depression.

      The patient may seek reassurance by consulting a doctor but have difficulties in believing the doctor when told that there is nothing to worry about and when reassured, the worrying may returns rapidly .
      When health anxiety or hypochondriacal preoccupation is most severe it takes the form of refusal of medical reassurance, with a belief that disease is present even when no abnormality is found in repeated examinations.  Respondents may believe that a diseases account for the symptoms and are        not satisfied with the way that medical experts have handled the case or with the conclusions and explanations offered. The patient  may contact one doctor (or other health care professional) after another and accept many treatments,  but reject assurances that there is no adequate physical         cause for the symptoms or presumed deformity.
